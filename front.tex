  My thesis explores the connection between knots and braids. In this presentation, we take a look at knot (link) invariants and the Artin braid group. We prove Alexander's theorem and Markov's theorem. These two theorems allow us to construct link invariants from representations of braid groups. We look at two such constructions: the Alexander-Conway polynomial from the Burau representation and the Jones polynomial from the Temperley-Lieb algebra.
