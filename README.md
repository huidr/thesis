Despite its lengthy title, my thesis has one main topic of study: the Jones polynomial. The title is simply a listing of the four chapters it has, each of which has a bold objective. The first chapter [Knots](#knots) lays the foundation for our study by introducing knot theory and much of the discussion is directed at polynomial invariants. We end the chapter by introducing the Jones polynomial. The second chapter [Braids](#braids) introduces the theory of braids and representation of braid groups. The object of this chapter is to establish the connection of knots with braids and how we may construct polynomial invariants from representations of the Artin braid group. In the third chapter [the Jones Polynomial](#the-jones-polynomial), we construct the Jones polynomial and use it to prove the Tait conjectures. In the fourth chapter [Khovanov Homology](#khovanov-homology), we categorify the Jones polynomial and in this way, we generalize the Jones polynomial to a homology theory.

## The Four Chapters &mdash; A Short Description

### Knots

This is a study of topics in knot theory which would be relevant to our study of the Jones polynomial. We look at knot invariants, colorability, alternating links and polynomial invariants. We introduce the Jones polynomial.

### Braids

We introduce braids and the Artin braid group. We establish the connection of knots with braids by stating and proving Alexander's theorem and Markov's theorem. We show that we can construct invariants from representations of braid groups. In particular, we use the Burau representation to construct the Alexander-Conway polynomial, a predecessor of the Jones polynomial.

### The Jones Polynomial

We describe the Temperley-Lieb algebra as a representation of the Artin braid group and construct the Jones polynomial from it. We introduce the state-summation model of the Jones polynomial and use it to prove some of the conjectures of classical knot theory. These are the famous Tait conjectures. We end the chapter by generalizing the Jones polynomial to the HOMFLY-PT polynomial.

### Khovanov Homology

[TO BE UPDATED]

The draft of my thesis is available [here](thesis.pdf). This was written in December 2023. A lot of things have changed since then. I am currently writing it and will soon upload it.
