<p>We look at the Jones polynomial, its construction, applications and generalizations. In particular, we study the braid groups, its representations and arrive at a construction of the Jones polynomial. We discuss proofs of the Tait conjectures. Then we construct Khovanov homology whose graded Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial.</p>
